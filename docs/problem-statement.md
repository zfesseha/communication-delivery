# Problem Statement

The company, Chronicle, provides direct-to-customer communications for other companies; specifically it sends emails, SMS, push notifications, and in-app messages to users. You are going to help Chronicle rebuild their core infrastructure; both designing the long-term architecture and developing the first iteration of the new product.

There are a few things you've been made aware of that are really important to Chronicle's customers:
- The flagship capability provided by Chronicle's current product is that their clients can easily A/B test their communications in order to understand the efficacy of each message's content, there would be a lot of attrition if this was not a focal point in the new product
- Clients want to be able to target cohorts, or groups, of their users and to send mass distributions based off of common metadata
- Their clients need to know the outcome of a message (e.g. which specific message was sent, was the message seen or not seen, opened or not opened, etc.) in order to take appropriate followup actions
